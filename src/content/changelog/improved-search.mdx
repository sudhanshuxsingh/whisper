We have revamped the search feature to provide quicker and more precise results. Now, finding past conversations and important files is easier than ever. You can search by keyword, date, and file type for improved accuracy.

## Key Improvements

Our team has focused on three primary areas to enhance your search experience: speed, accuracy, and usability. By optimizing our search algorithms and adding new filtering options, we've significantly reduced the time it takes to find what you're looking for.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

Add the following animations to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

<CodeWindow className='mt-4' language='tsx'>
{`'use client'

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc';

// Error boundary component as a functional component
function ErrorBoundary({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
const errorHandler = (error: ErrorEvent) => {
console.error('Error caught by error boundary:', error)
setHasError(true)
}

    window.addEventListener('error', errorHandler)

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('error', errorHandler)
    }

}, [])

if (hasError) {
return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>
}

return <>{children}</>
}

// Your other MDX components here
const components = {
h1: ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">{children}</h1>
),
h2: ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">{children}</h2>
),
// Add more components as needed
}

export function MDXComponents({ source }: { source: string }) {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MDXRemote
        source={source}
        components={components}
      />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  )
}`}
</CodeWindow>
