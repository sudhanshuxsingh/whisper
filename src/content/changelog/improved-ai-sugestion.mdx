Whisper now delivers smarter AI feedback suggestions by leveraging sphere context and user inputs, with real-time streaming for faster and seamless responses.

#### New Features
1. Context-Aware AI Suggestions  
   - The AI system now combines Sphere Title, Sphere Description, and User-Provided Feedback to generate detailed and contextually accurate feedback.  
   - This ensures responses are more aligned with the purpose of each sphere, enhancing relevance and usability.  

2. Real-Time Feedback Streaming  
   - Feedback is streamed incrementally, so users see suggestions evolve in real-time rather than waiting for the entire response to load.  
   - This new feature provides a faster and more dynamic user experience.  

#### Code Snippet for Streaming AI Suggestions  

<CodeWindow className='mt-4' language='tsx'>
{`'use server';
import { streamObject } from 'ai';
import { createStreamableValue, StreamableValue } from 'ai/rsc';
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { z } from 'zod';

type AISuggestionActionResponse = {
  message: string;
};

export async function getAISuggestionsAction(
  title: string,
  description: string,
  partial: string
): Promise<{
  object: StreamableValue<AISuggestionActionResponse>;
}> {
  const prompt = \`Generate/complete a feedbak/message for an annonymus feedback form with the title \${title} and desription \${description}. User may have already filled a partial text - \${partial ?? ''}\`;
  const stream = createStreamableValue();

  (async () => {
    const { partialObjectStream } = await streamObject({
      model: google('gemini-1.5-flash'),
      system:
        'You generate three feedbacks/messages for a annonymus feedback form whih will suggest users what feedback/messages they can provide',
      prompt,
      schema: z.object({
        message: z.string().describe('The feedback for the form'),
      }),
    });
    for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) {
      stream.update(partialObject);
    }
    stream.done();
  })();

  return { object: stream.value };
}`}
</CodeWindow>

#### Performance Enhancements
- Reduced latency in AI response generation by optimizing prompt structure and streaming logic.  
- Improved the responsiveness of the UI during feedback generation for a smoother experience.
